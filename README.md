Can't be bothered to use an app...send a text!

This applicaiton is a simple SMS calculator app based on the Clockwork SMS API. 

## How to use

Simply text your equation (e.g. 2+2) to 07860 033665 and the app will figure out the answer and send it back to you!

Pointless when there is a perfectly good calculator app on your phone? We thought so. But how could we make it better?

## Features

The application has some bonus features that reminds you of the days when you were a small child first exposed to the
wonders of the modern day calculator.

The SMS Service has 356 words that you can write on a standard 8 digit calculator screen...Who could forget the classic
upside-down calculator gag of 71077345 that spells "Shell Oil" when the calculator screen is turned upside down.

The application will also perform simple conversions...know how heavy you are in kilos, ask AnswerThis and it will tell you
in pounds. Like PI?...we do, ask it and it will round it to more decimal places than the tiny 8 character screen on your classic 
Casio can display!

There is also a browser application where completely useless facts about the calculations performed throughout the day 
can be displayed...No phone numbers are stored beyond the text message reply.

The browser application can be viewed at answerthis.cloudapp.net.
